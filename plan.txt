For my room’s renovation I would need to paint my walls and get new furniture,
since I need a new desk, my bed is falling apart and I could use some more shelves to store my things on.
First, I need to decide on walls’ color and what stores will I buy furniture, paint, nails and other essentials in.
Then I will go shopping for paint and essentials and order furniture.
Afterwards I will go home, secure the floor, my things and old furniture and paint my walls.
Then I will assemble new furniture.
Lastly I will arrange all of the furniture.
